# ITC-Store-project
<h1>Building the clone of ‘itcstore.in’</h1>

<p>Hello reader, Abhishek this side welcomes you to this blog post. Let me introduce you to the platform first, so “itcstore.in” is an e-commerce website, and we as a team was assigned the task to create the clone of this website from scratch, sounds interesting right? So let me take you a few days back where we are setting up our desks to initiate the development.</p>
<h4>Our team consists of 6 people including me(Abhishek), Akash, Surajit, Pavan, Vikash, and Domesh. We were totally new to each other and to remove this communication gap one casual meeting is required, hence a zoom meeting was scheduled and we all spent some time knowing each other, no work-related talk.</h4>
<h3>The First Day ( Initiating the project )</h3>
<p>So the previous night, we already had some random talks and now it was the time to discuss some work-related tasks. So we first had a deep view over the existing site and took note of things and functionalities. After that, we discussed the respective work ended the call and started working on our parts, We used to meet on a zoom call twice a day. This was the flow that was going on during the workdays.</p>
<h3>Tech Stack used</h3>
<p>In this whole fully functional website we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and also some new concepts of ES6.</p>
<h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
<p>If you are working on a big and full-stack project, there are always some challenges waiting for you, with us too it was nothing different.</p>
<h3>1. Health Issues</h3>
Not to forget this covid time, our team members got infected and suffered from health issues that hampered our team collaboration a bit but a big cheers to my team that our work never got stopped and we kept working in all situations.
<h3>2. Language Barrier</h3>
As our team members were from all different states and not everyone was comfortable with fluent English, communicating and sharing views became a bit of concern but again when your desires are positive and your willpower is strong you can overcome any barrier, We all managed to communicate to collaborate to this project,(Again cheers to my team).
<h3>3. Handling Backend</h3>
The most crucial part of any big website, we faced a bit problem at some phases, but in the end, we learned some new things and resolved all issues.
<h3>4. Time Constraint</h3>
Last but not the least, we had to complete the project in a span of 5 days, so there was a pressure that we were carrying with us, but with all our dedication and hard work we managed to complete it in just 4 days, surprised? but yes that is the truth.
Now let me take a pause and thank you as well for being with me till here, yes this smile that you are having right now, I care for that. Now let me showcase my project to you.
